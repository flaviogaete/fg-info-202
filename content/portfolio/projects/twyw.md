description: "I wrote, performed and produced the music soundtrack for this short film by Rodrigo Monterrey, which debuted this fall at the New England Online Film Festival. The soundtrack was inspired by Bernard Hermann & Hitchcock and features a 15-piece string orchestra recorded all by yours truly (except the cellos & basses which were mostly sampled)."
