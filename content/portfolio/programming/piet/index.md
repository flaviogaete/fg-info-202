## FIRST TITLE

![Telar routing features](telarRouting.png)

The Sensel Morph, with the Thunder Overlay, is connected to a MIDI track in Live, with an instance of Telar. Another MIDI track (or set of tracks) will hold an instance of the Telar Bus device, which is responsible for sending the corresponding MIDI out. The outgoing signal can be fed into an instrument in Live (it also works with MPE if you use inter-application MIDI communication), or an external MIDI output; Telar also comes with a suite of additional devices that allow you to convert MIDI control data or apply remote mappings so that you can control any parameter in Live.

## System Requirements

M4L devices built with Max 8.1.10. & recommended for Live 11.
