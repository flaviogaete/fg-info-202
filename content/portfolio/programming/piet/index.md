description: "Z端rich is a monophonic synthesizer featuring a swiss-army-knife-type oscillator bank, with the standard waveform generators, a waveshaper and a basic sample-playback engine. The standard oscillators can play up to 6 voices which can deviate in frequencies intuitively, easily creating rich, velvety textures. Also added is a noise generator (with white and pink types), and each generator comes with an independent filter (a Sallen & Key type, designed by Surreal Machines) and AR envelope. Most controls are readily available for MIDI mapping and automation."
