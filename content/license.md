### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
All my Max for Live devices were made with Live 11 and Max 8 (8.1.10), which are recommended for the devices to operate optimally.

The devices come with all their dependencies properly embedded ("frozen"). However, they've not been tested on Windows – if you run into any issues, please contact me.
